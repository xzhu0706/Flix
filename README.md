Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

- Problem: I added a tap gesture recognizer to the table view so that editing is ended for search bar if I tap on the table. However, the tap gesture conflicts with the table cell selection, which is evidenced by failing to select any movie cell when I tapped on the cell (a cell is selected if the background color shows up).
- Solution: I can avoid this conflict by implementing the gestureRecognizer function from the UIGestrueRecognizerDelegate. In the function, I set that the delegate should recognize and receive the tap only when the search bar is the first responder.
